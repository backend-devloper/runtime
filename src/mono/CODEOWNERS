# Mono Code Owners File
#
# GitHub uses this file to determine who to ping for reviews on pull requests.
# If you're the primary maintainer of an area of Mono and you don't mind
# reviewing pull requests, please add yourself to this file. You may want to
# avoid adding entries for commonly changed or automatically generated files
# (e.g. stuff in external/, or various generated *.csproj files) so as not to
# get spammed with emails.
#
# Note that if two patterns match a file, the later pattern takes precedence.
#
# Please keep this file alphabetically sorted.
