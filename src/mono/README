1. Compilation and Installation
===============================

   a. Build Requirements
   ---------------------

	To build Mono, you will need the following components:

		* pkg-config

		  Available from: http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/pkgconfig

		* glib 2.0

		  Available from: http://www.gtk.org/

	Optional dependencies:

	 	* ICU library

		  http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/index.html

		  You will need this one to get complete support for the international
		  features of the .NET Framework.

		* Cairo and libgdiplus

		  If you want to get support for System.Drawing, you will need to get
		  both Libgdiplus and Cairo.

    b. Building the Software
    ------------------------
  	
	If you obtained this package as an officially released tarball,
	this is very simple, use configure and make:

		./configure --prefix=/usr/local
		make
		make install

	Mono supports a JIT engine on x86, SPARC and PowerPC systems.
	The various commands that ship with Mono default to the JIT engine
	on x86 and SPARC, to turn it on for PPC systems, use the --with-jit=yes 
	command line option to configure.

	MacOS X Users: you will need to download the latest Boehm GC
	Alpha release for garbage collection to work properly.

	If you obtained this as a snapshot, you will need an existing
	Mono installation.  To upgrade your installation, unpack both
	mono and mcs:

		tar xzf mcs-XXXX.tar.gz
		tar xzf mono-XXXX.tar.gz
		mv mono-XXX mono
		mv mcs-XXX mcs
		cd mono
		./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local
		make

    c. Building the software from SVN
    ---------------------------------

	If you are building the software from SVN, make sure that you
	have up-to-date mcs and mono sources:

		svn co svn+ssh://USER@mono-cvs.ximian.com/source/trunk/mono
		svn co svn+ssh://USER@mono-cvs.ximian.com/source/trunk/mcs

	Then, go into the mono directory, and configure:

		cd mono
		./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local
		make

	This will automatically go into the mcs/ tree and build the
	binaries there, and copy them into the appropriate
	sub-directories of  mono/runtime/.

	This assumes that you have a working mono installation, and that
	there's a C# compiler named 'mcs', and a corresponding IL
	runtime called 'mono'.  You can use two make variables
	EXTERNAL_MCS and EXTERNAL_RUNTIME to override these.  e.g., you
	can say

	  make EXTERNAL_MCS=/foo/bar/mcs EXTERNAL_MONO=/somewhere/else/mono
	
	If you don't have a working Mono installation
	---------------------------------------------

	If you don't have a working Mono installation, an obvious choice
	is to install the latest released packages of 'mono' for your
	distribution and try from the beginning.

	You can also try a slightly more risky approach that should work
	almost all the time.  

	This works by first getting the latest version of the 'monolite'
	distribution, which contains just enough to run the 'mcs'
	compiler.  You do this with:

		make get-monolite-latest

	This will download and automatically gunzip and untar the
	tarball, and place the files appropriately so that you can then
	just run:

		make

	To ensure that you're using the 'monolite' distribution, you can
	also try passing EXTERNAL_MCS=false on the make command-line.

	Testing and Installation
	 ------------------------

	You can run (part of) the mono and mcs testsuites with the command:

		make check

	All tests should pass.  

	If you want more extensive tests, including those that test the
	class libraries, you need to re-run 'configure' with the
	'--enable-nunit-tests' flag, and try

		make -k check

	Expect to find a few testsuite failures.  As a sanity check, you
	can compare the failures you got with

		http://go-mono.com/tests/displayTestResults.php

	You can now install mono with:

		make install

	Failure to follow these steps may result in a broken installation. 

2. Using Mono
=============

	Once you have installed the software, you can run a few programs:

	* runtime engine

		mono program.exe
	  or
		mint program.exe

	* C# compiler

		mcs program.cs

	* CIL Disassembler

		monodis program.exe

	See the man pages for mono(1), mint(1), monodis(1) and mcs(2)
	for further details.
