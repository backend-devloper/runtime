1. Compilation and Installation
===============================

	If you obtained this package as an officially released tarball,
	this is very simple, use configure and make:

		./configure --prefix=/usr/local
		make
		make install

	If you obtained this as a snapshot, you will need an existing
	Mono installation.  To upgrade your installation do:

		./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local
		make fullbuild

2. Using Mono
=============

	Once you have installed the software, you can run a few programs:

	* runtime engine

		mono program.exe
	  or
		mint program.exe

	* C# compiler

		mcs program.cs

	* CIL Disassembler

		monodis program.exe

	See the man pages for mono(1), mint(1), monodis(1) and mcs(2)
	for further details.
