* ASP.NET

	ASP.NET support is divided in two pieces:
	<ul>
		* Web Forms (Web Applications infrastructure).

		* Web Services (the SOAP-based rpc system).
	</ul>

	Both are functional at this point, and applications like
	"IBuySpy" run with Mono.

	ASP.NET works either embedded into
	our XSP server test server or the mod_mono Apache module.

	We are now working bug fixing and adding missing features
	after making the whole pipeline compatible with MS.

	Tim started work on the Web Services.  Lluis is in charge of
	it now and web services are now supported. He also added a web
	service sample to the XSP server set of tests.

** Hosting

	ASP.NET provides a hosting interface.  Today we ship support
	for two different hosting mechanisms:
	<ul>
		* <a href="#xsp">XSP</a>: A light-weight C# web server.

		* <a href="#mod_mono">mod_mono</a>: An apache module
		  that can host the Mono runtime and the ASP.NET runtime
	</ul>

** XSP

	XSP is a simple web server written in C# that can be used to
	run your ASP.NET applications.  The code is available from our
	<a href="download.html">download page</a> or from the <a
	href="anoncvs.html">Anonymous CVS</a> repository (module name:
	xsp)/.
	
	This is where initial development of the .aspx/.ascx/.asax
	compiler to C# took place. That compiler is now integrated in
	System.Web classes mostly under System.Web.Compilation
	namespace.  We added a new web server that works with mono and
	MS runtime and is being used to debug our classes.  It resides
	in xsp/server.

	A couple of classes of this new server can be reused/extended
	to make an apache module/cgi using mono (MonoWorkerRequest and
	MonoApplicationHost).  This server also uses a couple of
	plugins distributed with Mono to support gzip HTTP transfers.

	There is also a set of .aspx pages to test the server along with
	a few user controls under xsp/test.

	You can check it out from CVS and run 'make install' to test it.

<a name="mod_mono">
* mod_mono

	This Apache module available at <a
	href="http://www.apacheworld.org/modmono/">ApacheWorld.org</a>
	hosts the Mono runtime and the Mono's ASP.NET runtime, and
	allows apache to server asp.net web pages.

	Work is underway to improve it.

** Controls

	A lot of work has been put in the various classes that
	implement the controls (UI.HtmlControls and UI.WebControls),
	but they have been coded mostly in the dark, and without being
	able to test them in real life: Gaurav and Leen worked very
	hard on this namespace.

	We can now render all HtmlControls and all WebControls.

	Help in making the controls better is appreciated.

** ASP.NET and free controls.

	We want to encourage developers to create open source controls
	that can be used both on Mono's ASP.NET and Microsoft's ASP.NET.  

** How to Help

        Testing and fixing HtmlControls, WebControls and validators is an
	easy way to help.

        In the CVS module XSP you can find a small web server used for
	testing and a directory containing sample aspx pages.

        You have some documentation under doc directory and in the README
        file of each directory. They explain how to test our System.Web.
        Testing is really easy!

	As the server also works with MS runtime, you can use it to check
	what the expected results are.
