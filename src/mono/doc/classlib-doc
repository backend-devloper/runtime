* Class Library Documentation

** Summary

	While using inline XML tags to document classes is certainly
	convenient, properly verbose documentation quickly overwhelms
	the code, making the source quite difficult to read.  Furthermore,
	multilingual documentation makes for significant additional text.
	
	With these considerations in mind, Mono will use external XML files
	for type documentation, rather than documenting the source
	inline.  The XML file format used is inspired by the XML format used
	to document the ECMA APIs.  

	Several tools will be created for managing, verifying, generating,
	and updating class library documentation, including:
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#monodoc">monodoc - A graphical documentation viewer.</a></li>
		<li>xmllint: a tool used to validate a proper XML document.
	</ul>

	You can download the tools to document Mono from the CVS
	repository from module `monodoc'.

** Documentation Tools

*** <a name="monodoc">MonoDoc</a>

	 A graphical documentation viewer written in Gtk#.  In the
	future we will have an ASP.NET front-end to present the
	documentation on the web as well.
