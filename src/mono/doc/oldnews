@item Oct 25th: GTK# 0.11+ Windows Installer available

	Johannes created a Windows
	Installer for GTK# 0.11+ and works
	with Mono 0.28 for Windows.

@item Oct 21st: Mono Community at Novell Forge

	Mono Developers that are looking for a public repository for
	hosting their projects can now use <a
	href="http://forge.novell.com">Novell Forge's</a> which hosts
	a <a
	href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/community/?monocomm">Mono
	Community</a>.

	Novell Forge offers mailing lists, cvs repository, bug
	tracking and mailing list services and all the other services
	you expect.  Mono will continue to be hosted in our own CVS
	repository, and using our <a href="anoncvs.html">anonymous CVS
	servers</a>

@item Oct 13th: SPARC V9, HPPA, Internationalization, GdiPlus

	Dick Porter has checked in our rewrite of the international
	substrate in Mono that uses the <a
	href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/">International
	Components for Unicode</a> library from IBM.  This means that
	we got CultureInfo support through the whole code base now.

	Alexandre Pigolkine has checked-in the new implementation of
	System.Drawing.  We have now dropped the old implementation
	with multiple-backends that we had, and replaced it with an
	implementation that P/Invokes into GDI+.  A GDI+
	implementation on top of <a
	href="http://www.cairographics.org">Cairo</a> is used on Unix
	systems.  This step vastly simplifies the development and
	maintenance of System.Drawing. 

	There are plenty of updates to Mono as well, we encourage you
	to read the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/monologue">Monologue</a> to keep
	an eye on recent developments.

	Bernie Solomon just <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-October/002460.html">checked
	in</a> 64-bit support for SPARC v9 and HPPA into the Mono
	runtime.  This also improves the SPARC-32 support.

@item Oct 6th: Linux s390 Mono packages available.

	Neale Ferguson has contributed Mono packages for the
	Linux/s390.  You can get them from the <a

@item Sep 26th, 2003: DiaCanvas# 0.1 released, Gtk# 0.11 released.

	Mike Kestner has <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gtk-sharp-list/2003-September/002475.html">released</a>
	a new version of <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a>.

	Martin has also 
        <a href="http://mwh.sysrq.dk/programs/announcements/diacanvas-sharp-0.1.0.html">released</a>
	his binding to <a href="http://diacanvas.sf.net">DiaCanvas</a> for C#.

@item Sep 16th, 2003: WineLib, Authenticode, Generics, Xslt updates, Wsdl compiler, WSE.

	<b>WineLib:</b> Vladimir has added new libraries to the Wine
	process, which we will soon bring into our packages: the
	various Windows common dialogs can now be used (screenshots:
	<a href="images/colordlg.png">here</a>, <a
	href="images/fontdlg.png">here</a>, <a
	href="images/filedlg.png">here</a> and <a
	href="images/finddlg.png">here</a>.

	Johannes has patches to have Wine track the Gtk theme,
	screenshot here (link got broken).

	<b>Security:</b> New authenticode support from Sebastien has
	been checked into CVS.

	<b>Xslt:</b> Plenty of conformance updates to the managed
	implementation of Xslt, as well as breaking the libxslt speed
	barrier.  Our managed implementation is now faster than the
	C-based libxslt that we used before.

	<b>Generics:</b> Work continues on generics support, feel free
	to try it out.  The compiler is currently on a separate
	directory until we stability it (gmcs) and you need to compile
	the class libraries with the `generics' profile to try it
	out.  Sample generic programs are included in the CVS module. 

	<b>Wsdl:</b> We now have Wsdl support in Mono: a wsdl compiler
	command line tool, and support on ASP.NET to generate the wsdl
	file from an .asmx file.

	<b>AOT:</b> Many robustness updates to the ahead-of-time
	compiler and a new locking and threading system that avoids
	having "big locks" around the mono kernel, and moves to a
	fine-grained locking system.  The design includes a lattice to
	avoid deadlocks.

	<b>Dogfooding:</b> We are now running Mono's ASP.NET on
	go-mono.com to find problems.  It is currently hosting our
	Monodoc documentation.  The <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/index.html">Apache module
	version</a> and the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com:8080/">XSP
	version</a>.

	<b>WSE:</b> The Web Services Enhancements season has begun.
	The Microsoft.Web.Services namespace and classes are now
	checked into CVS.  

@item Sep 1st, 2003: Ice for Mono;  XmlSerializer generators; Monodoc progress.

	<b>Ice:</b> Vladimir has checked into CVS (Module ginzu) an
	implementation of <a href="http://www.zeroc.com">ZeroC's</a>
	<a href="http://www.zeroc.com/ice.html">ICE</a> protocol.  It
	is implemented using Remoting.  If you were looking for an
	efficient binary protocol to use with Remoting, this is it.

	ICE is simpler to use than CORBA, and was created by people
	who were deeply involved in CORBA and wanted to fix its
	problems (you can see a <a
	href="http://www.zeroc.com/iceVsCorba.html">list of
	differences</a>).

	<b>XmlSerializer</b>: Lluis has checked in a new technology
	for use in our XmlSerializer: the XmlSerializer code
	generator.  Currently our XmlSerializer generates a
	description of instructions for serializing data, these
	instructions are later interpreted while using it: Reflection
	is used to pull all the data.  The code generator is the first
	step into turning the Serializer from an intepreter into a
	compiler and improving the performance of it.

	Currently was used internally to implement the WSDL
	serializer, in the future it will just be part of the standard
	serialization process.

	<b>MonoDoc:</b> New providers!  Thanks to <a
	href="http://www.jaggersoft.com/">Jon Jagger</a> for providing
	us with his master XML files for the C# specification we now
	have integrated the C# spec into Monodoc.  Another provider is
	the Error provider: now we include all the C# compiler errors
	in the help system.

	Alp has contributed various user interface improvement, and
	updated our list widget for key navigation; Ben made the
	matches window more useful and Joshua has helped us clean up
	the ECMA provider even more.

@item Aug 14th, 2003: Mono 0.26 has been released

	A new version of Mono is available, the new features include:
	<a href="http://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo support</a>, <a
	href="http://remoting-corba.sf.net">Remoting.Corba</a>
	support, as well as a managed XSLT implementation.  

	Existing features have been improved vastly: better
	Windows.Forms, runtime, faster compiler, web services, better
	compliance to the spec and more. 

	Check out the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.26.html">Release
	notes</a> for details.

@item Aug 9th, 2003: Python for .NET Preview 2 available;  Mono Documentation site up.

	Brian Lloyd has <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-August/015313.html">announced</a>
	the availability of his Python binding to .NET.  This works
	with .NET and Mono.  For more information about it, see
	Brian's site at <a href="
	http://zope.org/Members/Brian/PythonNet/">http://zope.org/Members/Brian/PythonNet/</a>

	We have uploaded the current Mono Documentation (core
	libraries and Gtk#) to <a
	href="http://mono.ximian.com:8080"/>http://mono.ximian.com:8080</a>.
	The site is running the ASP.NET edition of <a
	href="archive/monodoc-0.6.tar.gz">MonoDoc 0.6</a> on XSP.

@item Aug 6th, 2003: Winforms samples

	Timothy Parez is coordinating the effort to create sample
	programs that exercise the various Windows.Forms controls.  We
	are using this as graphical regression test suite for the Mono
	implementation.

	The screenshots of the various widgets, together with the
	source code is available on the <a
	href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples">WineSamples</a>
	page on the <a
	href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/">Mono Wiki</a>.

	A new cvs module called `winforms' has been created that
	contains the source code for the samples.  To run the samples,
	you can install the WineLib packages available from our <a
	href="download.html">download page</a>.

@item Aug 5th, 2003: New Apache Module architecture: 1.3 and 2.x supported

	Gonzalo rearchitected our Apache module for hosting Mono and
	ASP.NET.  The previous incarnation hosted a Mono runtime on
	each Apache process, which lead to a slow setup for webforms.
	The new setup uses a shared mono process for all the incoming
	requests.  Daniel later improved up the new architecture and
	added dual support, so now in addition to Apache 2.x, we
	support Apache 1.3 with the same codebase.

	The new code is available on CVS, on module `mod_mono', and
	now requires an XSP installation to be available. 

@item Aug 4th, 2003: Ximian acquired by Novell.

	Today <a href="http://www.novell.com">Novell</a> acquired <a
	href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a>.  The press release is
	available <a
	href="http://www.ximian.com./about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=novell">here</a>.

	Mono and Gnome form an integral part of the Novell strategy.

@item Jul 30th, 2003: Remoting.CORBA, Managed XSLT.

	Today Lluis announced that Mono CVS contains all the fixes to
	run <a
	href="http://remoting-corba.sourceforge.net/">Remoting.CORBA</a>:
	both client and server channels work; We are interested in people
	testing it with other ORBs.

	Ben checked-in today his managed implementation of Xslt that
	we mentioned on Jul 19th; This uncovered various limitations
	on the XPath implementation, which Piers has swifly removed.
	Monodoc, NUnit and our Corcompare work with it.  Since this is
	implementation is not completed yet, we still support the
	libxslt-based version by default.  For more details on how to
	try the new XSLT implementation, see <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-July/001681.html">Ben's
	post</a>

@item Jul 27th, 2003: Wine packages and Daily Snapshots 

	MonoWine packages (used to run System.Windows.Forms) software
	are now available from our (<a
	href="download.html">download</a> page).  You can track the
	progress on our <a
	href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples">Wiki
	page.</a>

	We're now building daily snapshots of Mono.  They come in
	three distinct flavors:

	<ul>
		* mono snapshot tarballs - These are 'release-style' tarballs and
		  contain everything necessary to setup a new
		  installation from scratch.  This includes the Mono
	 	  runtime and all the assemblies we distribute.

		* monocharge tarballs - These tarballs contain only
		  the assemblies built on that day.

		* monolite tarballs - These tarballs contain a copy of
		  'corlib.dll', 'mcs.exe', 'System.dll', 'System.Xml.dll' and
		  'Mono.CSharp.Debugger.dll'. They can be used to
		  re-bootstrap an out-of-sync installation.
	</ul>

	The daily builds are availble here: <a href="http://go-mono.com/daily">http://go-mono.com/daily</a>

	If you find that the builds are broken, please notify Duncan.

@item Jul 19th, 2003: Recent developments

	Since Mono has matured, we have limited the news on the site
	to major accomplishments that are finished, but this week, it
	is worth devoting some time to talk about some of the
	work-in-progress projects that are progressing.

	Jackson has added support to the IL assembler for generics as
	well as to the PEAPI library, and it has assembled its first
	generic program.  Support for handling images with generics
	has been on our file format reader for a while, but the JIT
	engine is still incomplete. 

	On the XSLT world, Atsushi and Ben continue to make big
	improvements.  Ben recently got the prototype managed XSLT
	implementation to run its first stylesheet.  Although
	currently Mono uses libxslt to implement the System.Xml.Xsl
	namespace, to have a fully .NET compliant implementation we
	will need a managed version, and this is the beginning of it.

	Lluis recently posted an update on the <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-July/001550.html">state
	of WSDL</a> in Mono.  Now that the web services runtime is
	ready, the WSDL compiler becomes more important as a
	development tool.

	Atsushi continues his work on the DTD validating reader in
	System.Xml, as well as improving our XML Schema support.

@item Jul 14th, 2003: New build system;  IPV6 support.

	Peter Williams has contributed a new build system that
	addresses many of the annoyance we had with our previous build
	system.  He has worked on this for a few weeks, and Gonzalo
	helped test it and get it into CVS.  We no longer have the
	historical dual build system: make for Unix and nant for
	Windows.

	This system also offers the opportunity to compile our class
	libraries with different profiles (.NET 1.0, .NET 1.1 and the
	various ECMA subsets).

	Peter explains the new build system <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-July/001506.html">here</a>

	Jerome's IPV6 code has been checked into CVS; With Peter's new
	build system, we will be able to expose it (as part of the
	NET_1_1 build).


@item Jul 9th, 2003: ASP.NET web services, coverage tools.

	Web Services keep advancing: now we also support server-side
	authoring of Web Services as well as web service clients
	(which shipped in Mono 0.25).  This works using our ASP.NET
	runtime, so it works with either XSP or the Apache module. The
	new Web Services work from Lluis added the missing bits:
	<ul>
		<li> .asmx files.
		<li> Method calls with complex parameters (whatever XmlSerializer can currently serialize, which is a quite a lot).
		<li> ref and out parameters.
		<li> Soap headers (In, Out and InOut).
		<li> Soap extensions, both global (configured in web.config) and particular to methods (configured using attributes).
	</ul>

	For more details, see Lluis <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-July/001449.html">post</a>

	GUI-wise: Work on <a href="http://xr.xwin.org">Xr</a> to
	implement System.Drawing continues.  This will provide a full
	GDI+ implementation for Mono, and this will be hooked up into
	Gtk# and System.Windows.Forms.

	MonoDoc keeps moving along, with a new web-based version
	coming up next, and we are also exploring a collaborative
	extension to allow people to contribute documentation through
	their web browsers.

	Zoltan's Coverage analysis tool has been checked into CVS.
	With this tool it is now possible to find which class library
	code paths are missing regression tests.  The module is
	`monocov'.  Details are <a
	href="http://www.nexus.hu/vargaz/">here</a>.  A fresh Gtk#
	version is available now.

	Jean's remoting-based Soap implenentation is also maturing.

@item Jun 26th: Mono 0.25 has been released.

	We have released Mono 0.25.  A list of the new features is
	available <a href="archive/mono-0.25.html">here</a>.  

	Packages for Windows, and various Linux distributions are
	available on our <a href="download.html">download</a> page.

@item Jun 17th, 2003: Web Services client; Profiling hooks

	Lluis and Gonzalo have checked into CVS the support for web
	services in the Mono runtime.  This allows Mono to work as a
	web services client.  We still require a WSDL compiler to
	compile the initial stub, but Erik has the beginning of a WSDL
	compiler ready and Atsushi has continued work on his
	experimental Xml Schema to C# class generator.  

	As part of this, the Mono Http runtime has been rewritten to
	increase reliability, scalability and conformance to the
	specs.  Also our io-layer has been extended to not have
	arbitrary limits.  This was done as part of our collaboration
	with SourceGear.

	Paolo has commited the new pluggable profiling API to the Mono
	runtime: now the profiler is built as a module, and a new code
	coverage analysis has been checked in (and Zoltan already
	added improvements to it).

	Mark's Mozilla bindings continue to improve, and we will shortly
	migrate the Mono documentation browser to use Mozilla, to take
	advantage of the tutorial's use of CSS.

	Jackson's work on the IL assembler and Ben on running
	regression tests have provided us with a very needed tool in
	the Mono toolkit.  One of the last missing pieces on the SDK.

	On the crypto world, we got Sebastien's certificate viewer
	checked into CVS and the crypto code keeps advancing by leaps
	and bounds.

	Alexandre and Aleksey Work continues on Windows.Forms on top
	of Wine and Gtk# (the former for full compatibility, the later
	for ease-of-authoring).

	Cesar checked in the beginning of the semantic analysis code
	for his JScript compiler, and will be working on it full time.

@item Jun 11th, 2003: SourceGear and Ximian announce partnership

	Ximian, Inc., the leading provider of desktop and server
	solutions enabling enterprise Linux adoption, today announced
	that SourceGear Corporation will use Mono\x{2122} Project
	technology to offer cross-platform versions of its
	products. In addition, the companies have entered into a
	development partnership under which Ximian will provide
	custom Mono development to enable delivery of SourceGear
	products later this year. As a result, SourceGear will offer
	both UNIX and Linux clients for its SourceGear Vault source
	code management tool, enabling broader use of its solutions in
	mixed-platform development organizations.
