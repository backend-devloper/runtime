* XML Classes

** Abstract

  XML library is used by several field of Mono such as ADO.NET and XML 
  Digital Signature (xmldsig). Here I write about System.Xml.dll and 
  related tools. This page won't include any classes which are in other 
  assemblies such as XmlDataDocument.

  Note that current corlib has its own XML parser class named Mono.Xml.MiniParser.

  Basically System.XML.dll feature has finished, or almost finished, so
  I write this page mainly for bugs and improvement hints.


** System.Xml namespace


*** Document Object Model (Core)

  DOM feature has already implemented. There is still missing feature.

	<ul>
		* ID constraint support is problematic because W3C DOM does not 
		  specify handling of ID attributes into non-adapted element. 
		  (MS.NET also looks incomplete in this area).
		* I think, event feature is not fully tested. There are no
		  concrete desctiption on which events are risen, so we have to
		  do some experiment on MS.NET.
	</ul>

*** Xml Writer

  Here XmlWriter almost equals to XmlTextWriter. If you want to see
  another implementation, check XmlNodeWriter.cs used in monodoc.

  XmlTextWriter is completed. However, it looks nearly twice as slow as 
  MS.NET (I tried 1.1)

*** XmlResolver

  Currently XmlTextReader uses specified XmlResolver. If nothing was supplied,
  then it uses XmlUrlResolver. XmlResolver is used to parse external DTD,
  importing XSL stylesheets and schemas etc.

  However, XmlUrlResolver is still buggy (mainly because System.Uri is also
  incomplete yet) and this results in several loading error.

  XmlSecureResolver, which is introduced in MS .NET Framework 1.1 is basically
  implemented, but it requires CAS (code access security) feature. We need to
  fixup this class after ongoing CAS effort works.

  You might also be interested in an improved <a href="http://codeblogs.ximian.com/blogs/benm/archives/000039.html">XmlCachingResolver</a> by Ben Maurer.

*** XmlNameTable

  XmlNameTable itself is implemented. However, it should be actually used in
  several classes. Currently it makes sense if compared names are both in
  the table, they should be simply compared using ReferenceEquals(). We 
  have partially done in XmlNamespaceManager (in .NET 1.2 methods; if the
  build is not NET_1_2 then it is internal use only).

*** Xml Stream Reader

  When we are using ASCII document, we don't care which encoding we are using.
  However, XmlTextReader must be aware of the specified encoding in XML
  declaration. So we have internal XmlStreamReader class (and currently
  XmlInputStream class. This may disappear since XmlStreamReader is enough to
  handle this problem).

  However, there seems some problems in these classes on reading network
  stream (especially on Linux). This should be fixed soon, if we found the
  actual reason.

*** XML Reader

  XmlTextReader, XmlNodeReader and XmlValidatingReader are almost finished.

	<ul>
		* Most of the OASIS conformance test passes as Microsoft 
		  does, but about W3C tests, it is still not perfect.
		* I won't add any XDR support on XmlValidatingReader. (I haven't
		  ever seen XDR used other than Microsoft's BizTalk Server 2000,
		  and Now they have 2002 with XML Schema support)
	</ul>

  XmlTextReader and XmlValidatingReader should be faster than now. Currently
  XmlTextReader looks nearly twice as slow as MS.NET, and XmlValidatingReader
  (which uses this slow XmlTextReader) looks nearly three times slower. (Note
  that XmlValidatingReader won't be slow as itself. It uses schema validating
  reader and dtd validating reader.)


**** Some Advantages

  The design of Mono's XmlValidatingReader is radically different from
  that of Microsoft's implementation. Under MS.NET, DTD content validation
  engine is in fact simple replacement of XML Schema validation engine.
  Mono's DTD validation is designed fully separate and does validation
  as normal XML parser does. For example, Mono allows non-deterministic DTD.

  Another advantage of this XmlValidatingReader is support for *any* XmlReader.
  Microsoft supports only XmlTextReader.

  I added extra support interface named "IHasXmlParserContext", which is
  considered in XmlValidatingReader.ResolveEntity(). Microsoft failed to 
  design XmlReader to support pluggable use of XmlReader (i.e. wrapping use
  of other XmlReader) since XmlParserContext is required to support both
  entity resolution and namespace manager. (In .NET 1.2, Microsoft also 
  supported similar to IHasXmlParserContext, named IXmlNamespaceResolver,
  but it still does not provide any DTD information.)

  We also have RELAX NG validating reader. See mcs/class/Commons.Xml.Relaxng.


** System.Xml.Schema

*** Summary

  Basically it is completed. We can compile complex and simple types, refer to
  external schemas, extend or restrict other types, or use substitution groups.
  You can test how current schema validation engine is (in)complete by using
  standalone test module 
  (see mcs/class/System.XML/Test/System.Xml.Schema/standalone_tests).
  At least in my box, msxsdtest fails only 30 cases with bugfixed catalog.

*** Schema Object Model

  Completed, except for some things to be fixed:

	<ul>
		* Complete facet support. Currently some of them is missing.
		  Recently David Sheldon is doing several fixes on them.
		* ContentTypeParticle for pointless xs:choice is incomplete
		  (It is because fixing this arose another bugs in 
		  compilation. Interestingly, MS.NET also fails around here,
		  so it might be nature of ContentTypeParticle design)
		* Some derivation by restriction (DBR) handling is incorrect.
	</ul>

*** Validating Reader

  XML Schema validation feature is (currently) implemented on
  Mono.Xml.Schema.XsdValidatingReader, which is internally used in
  XmlValidatingReader.

  Basically this is implemented and actually its feature is almost complete,
  but I have only did validation feature testing. So we have to write more 
  tests on properties, methods, and events (validation errors).


** System.Xml.Serialization

  Lluis rules ;-)

  Well, in fact XmlSerializer is almost finished and is on bugfix phase.

  However, we appliciate more tests. Please try 
  
  	<ul>
		* System.Web.Services to invoke SOAP services.
  		* xsd.exe and wsdl.exe to create classes.
	</ul>

  And if any problems were found, please file it to bugzilla.

  Lluis also built interesting standalone test system placed under
  mcs/class/System.Web.Services/Test/standalone.

  You might also interested in genxs, which enables you to create custom
  XML serializer. This is not included in Microsoft.NET. 
  See mcs/tools/genxs for the details.


** System.Xml.XPath and System.Xml.Xsl

  There are two implementations for XSLT. One (and historical) implementation
  is based on libxslt. Now we uses fully implemented managed XSLT.

  As for Managed XSLT, we support msxsl:script.

  It would be nice if we can support <a href="http://www.exslt.org/">EXSLT</a>.
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/WebServices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnexxml/html/xml05192003.asp">Microsoft has already done it</a>, but it
  is not good code since it depends on internal concrete derivatives of
  XPathNodeIterator classes. In general, .NET's "extension objects" is not
  usable to return node-sets, so if we support EXSLT, it has to be done
  internally inside our System.XML.dll. Volunteers are welcome.

  Our managed XSLT implementation is still inefficient. XslTransform.Load()
  and .Transform() looks three times slower (However it depends on 
  XmlTextReader which is also slow, so we are starting optimization from
  that class, not XSLT itself). These number are only for specific cases,
  and there might be more critical point on XSLT engine (mainly
  XPathNodeIterator).


** System.Xml and ADO.NET v2.0

  Microsoft introduced the first beta version of .NET Framework 1.2 runtime
  and sdk (and Visual Studio Whidbey). They are now available on MSDN
  _subscriber_ download (i.e. it is not publicly downloadable yet). It
  contains several new classes.

  There are two assemblies related to System.Xml v2.0; System.Xml.dll and
  System.Data.SqlXml.dll (here I treat sqlxml.dll as part of System.Xml v2.0,
  but note that it is also one of the ADO.NET 2.0 feature). There are several 
  namespaces such as MS.Internal.Xml and System.Xml. Note that .NET Framework
  is pre-release version and MS.Internal.Xml namespace apparently shows that
  it is not in stable status as yet.

  System.Xml 2.0 contains several features such as:

  <ul>
		* XPathNavigator2 and XPathDocument2
		* XML Query
		* XmlAdapter
		* XSLT IL generator (similar to Apache XSLTC) - it is 
		  internal use
  </ul>

  Tim Coleman started ADO.NET 2.0 related works. Currently I have no plan to
  implement System.Xml v2.0 classes and won't touch with them immediately, 
  but will start in next some months. If any of you wants to try this
  frontier, we welcome your effort.

*** XPathNavigator2

  System.Xml v2.0 implementation will be started from XPathDocument2 and
  XPathNavigator2 implementations. Firstly, its document structure and
  basic navigation feature will be implemented. And next, XPath2 engine
  should be implemented (XPathNavigator2 looks very different from
  XPathNavigator). Another requirement is schema based validation feature.
  It needs some schema improvements, such like IXmlInfosetReader support.
  (IXmlInfosetReader is in MS.Internal.Xml.)

*** XML Query

  XML Query is a new face XML data manipulation language (well, at least new
  to .NET world). It is similar to SQL, but intended to manipulate and to
  support XML. It is similar to XSLT, but extended to support new features
  such as XML Schema based datatypes.

  XML Query implementation can be found mainly in System.Xml.Query and 
  MS.Internal.Xml.Query namespaces. Note that they are in 
  System.Data.SqlXml.dll.

  MSDN documentation says that there are two kind of API for XML Query: High
  Level API and Low Level API. At the time of this beta version, the Low Level
  API is described not released yet (though it may be MS.Internal.Xml.*
  classes). However, to implement the High Level API, the Low Level API will 
  be used. They looks to have interesting class structures in MS.Internal.Xml 
  related stuff, so it would be nice (and I will) start to learn about them.

  They looks to have IL generator classes, but it would be difficult to
  start from them.

*** System.Data.Mapping

  System.Data.Mapping and System.Data.Mapping.RelationalSchema are the
  namespaces for mapping support between database and xml. This is at
  stubbing phase (incomplete as yet).

*** XmlAdapter

  XmlAdapter is used to support XML based query and update using 
  XPathDocument2 and XPathNavigator2. This class is designed to synthesize
  ADO.NET and System.Xml. It connects to databases, and querys data however
  in XML shape into XPathDocument2, using Mapping schema above. This must be
  done after several classes such as XPathDocument2 and MappingSchema.


** Miscellaneous Class Libraries

*** RELAX NG

  I implemented an experimental RelaxngValidatingReader. It is far from
  complete, especially simplification stuff (see RELAX NG spec chapter 4),
  some constraints (in chapter 7), and datatype handling.

  I am planning improvements (starts with renaming classes, giving more
  kind error messages, supporting compact syntax and even object mapping),
  but it is still my wishlist.


** Tools

*** xsd.exe

  See <a href="ado-net.html">ADO.NET page</a>.

  Microsoft has another inference class from XmlReader to XmlSchemaCollection
  (Microsoft.XsdInference). It may be useful, but it won't be so easy.


** Miscellaneous

  Sometimes I hear complain about System.dll and System.Xml.dll mutual
  dependency: System.dll references to System.Xml.dll (e.g. 
  System.Configuration.ConfigXmlDocument extended from XmlDocument), while 
  System.Xml.dll vice versa (e.g. XmlUrlResolver.ResolveUri takes System.Uri).
  Since they are in public method signatures, so at least we cannot get rid
  of these mutual references.

  However, for those who really want to build System.Xml.dll without System.dll,
  I created <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~atsushi/System_DummyClasses.cs">dummy classes in System.dll</a>. To build System.Xml.dll in such way, remove 
  <code>/r:System.dll</code> from Makefile, and add this source to 
  System.Xml.dll.sources. Note that this is at the point of Mono 0.30 release.

  Also note that you still need System.dll to run mcs.
