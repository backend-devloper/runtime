The purpose of eglib is to be an X11-licensed subset of glib that can
be used with Mono when the Mono runtime is explicitly relicensed under
a different license by Novell.

The implementation is done from the public documentation available here:

    http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/

Currently this is only being built standalone, use:

	  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/tmp/test

Currently all the definitions go into a single file: glib.h, there are 
no separate files, please try to follow the convetions in the source code

* Tests

	Please run the tests in the test/ directory, like this:

	        $ test

	Once the tests pass, run them with valgrind to ensure that
	there are no leaks, like this:

		$ valgrind test

        You can also run the tests against the original glib, to do
	this, use:

	        $ cd test
		$ ./other
