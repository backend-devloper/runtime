* Code that we will drop from Mono, because we do not really need this:

  Locking:

      5 G_LOCK
      5 G_UNLOCK

      These are currently only used for the GC-safe hash table, and 
      we will be replacing that with a copy of our own hashtable.

Important Groups:

	* Process launching
	      3 g_shell_quote
	      1 g_shell_unquote

        * Thread enabling, these might be just no-ops, check with Paolo/Zoltan
	      3 g_thread_supported
	      3 g_thread_init

        * Information retrieval
	      1 g_win32_getlocale
	
	* String manipulation
	      1 g_filename_from_utf8	[LIMITATION: UTF8 only today]
	      1 g_ascii_strdown
	     10 g_strlcpy
	      2 g_strdelimit
	      1 g_strescape
	
	* Miscelaneous
	      3 g_spaced_primes_closest
	      2 g_printerr
	      1 g_mem_set_vtable
	      1 g_log_set_handler

Remove code from Mono:

	Multi-threaded aware GHashTable.
	utils/mono-uri.c

Macros:
      6 G_UNLIKELY
      4 G_LIKELY
      2 G_USEC_PER_SEC
      2 G_STRLOC
      1 G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH
      1 G_ALLOC_ONLY

* Unimplemented, not supported currently:

		g_unichar_tolower	Used for deprecated unmanaged string collation
		g_unichar_type		Used for deprecated unmanaged string collation

* Dead Code

	The GMainLoop code was no longer in use in Mono.

* Windows implementations needed

  Directory, File manipulation:

       g_dir_open, g_dir_close, g_dir_read_name

       We're missing a native windows implementation. The unix one is in place.
