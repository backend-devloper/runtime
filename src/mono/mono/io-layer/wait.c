/**
 * SignalObjectAndWait:
 * @signal_handle: An object to signal
 * @wait: An object to wait for
 * @timeout: The maximum time in milliseconds to wait for
 * @alertable: Specifies whether the function returnes when the system
 * queues an I/O completion routine or an APC for the calling thread.
 *
 * Atomically signals @signal and waits for @wait to become signalled,
 * or @timeout ms elapses.  If @timeout is zero, the object's state is
 * tested and the function returns immediately.  If @timeout is
 * %INFINITE, the function waits forever.
 *
 * @signal can be a semaphore, mutex or event object.
 *
 * If @alertable is %TRUE and the system queues an I/O completion
 * routine or an APC for the calling thread, the function returns and
 * the thread calls the completion routine or APC function.  If
 * %FALSE, the function does not return, and the thread does not call
 * the completion routine or APC function.  A completion routine is
 * queued when the ReadFileEx() or WriteFileEx() function in which it
 * was specified has completed.  The calling thread is the thread that
 * initiated the read or write operation.  An APC is queued when
 * QueueUserAPC() is called.  Currently completion routines and APC
 * functions are not supported.
 *
 * Return value: %WAIT_ABANDONED - @wait is a mutex that was not
 * released by the owning thread when it exited.  Ownershop of the
 * mutex object is granted to the calling thread and the mutex is set
 * to nonsignalled.  %WAIT_IO_COMPLETION - the wait was ended by one
 * or more user-mode asynchronous procedure calls queued to the
 * thread.  %WAIT_OBJECT_0 - The state of @wait is signalled.
 * %WAIT_TIMEOUT - The @timeout interval elapsed and @wait's state is
 * still not signalled.  %WAIT_FAILED - an error occurred.
