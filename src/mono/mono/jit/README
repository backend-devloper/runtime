Hello fellow developer,

    This directory contains the first implementation of the Mono just-in-time
compiler.  This is what most people use as of April 2003 but we are phasing it
out in favor of the new compilation architecture found in the directory "mini".

    We encourage developers and contributors to look at the other JIT engine,
as it is more extensible, easier, cleaner and more powerful.

Miguel.
