/*
 * This is how the copying happens from the nursery to the old generation.
 * We assume that at this time all the pinned objects have been identified and
 * marked as such.
 * We run scan_object() for each pinned object so that each referenced
 * objects if possible are copied. The new gray objects created can have
 * scan_object() run on them right away, too.
 * Then we run copy_object() for the precisely tracked roots. At this point
 * all the roots are either gray or black. We run scan_object() on the gray
 * objects until no more gray objects are created.
 * At the end of the process we walk again the pinned list and we unmark
 * the pinned flag. As we go we also create the list of free space for use
 * in the next allocation runs.
 *
 * We need to remember objects from the old generation that point to the new one
 * (or just addresses?).
 *
 * copy_object could be made into a macro once debugged (use inline for now).
