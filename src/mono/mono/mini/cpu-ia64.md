# ia64 cpu description file
# this file is read by genmdesc to pruduce a table with all the relevant information
# about the cpu instructions that may be used by the register allocator, the scheduler
# and other parts of the arch-dependent part of mini.
#
# An opcode name is followed by a colon and optional specifiers.
# A specifier has a name, a colon and a value. Specifiers are separated by white space.
# Here is a description of the specifiers valid for this file and their possible values.
#
# dest:register       describes the destination register of an instruction
# src1:register       describes the first source register of an instruction
# src2:register       describes the second source register of an instruction
#
# register may have the following values:
#	i  integer register
#	b  base register (used in address references)
#	f  floating point register
#
# len:number         describe the maximun length in bytes of the instruction
# number is a positive integer
#
# cost:number        describe how many cycles are needed to complete the instruction (unused)
#
# clob:spec          describe if the instruction clobbers registers or has special needs
#
# spec can be one of the following characters:
#	c  clobbers caller-save registers
#	r  'reserves' the destination register until a later instruction unreserves it
#          used mostly to set output registers in function calls
#
# flags:spec        describe if the instruction uses or sets the flags (unused)
#
# spec can be one of the following chars:
# 	s  sets the flags
#       u  uses the flags
#       m  uses and modifies the flags
#
# res:spec          describe what units are used in the processor (unused)
#
# delay:            describe delay slots (unused)
#
# the required specifiers are: len, clob (if registers are clobbered), the registers
# specifiers if the registers are actually used, flags (when scheduling is implemented).
