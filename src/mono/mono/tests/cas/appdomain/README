AppDomain sandboxes


* makepol.cs:	Create some XML policy files to be used with the sandboxes.
* sandbox.cs:	Create a policy-restricted appdomain to execute assemblies.


Samples

* whoami.cs:	Sample code that can be executed under a sandbox.


Generated files

* Mono doesn't (at least currently) ship with XML policy files. So the 
makepol.exe tool creates policies similar (i.e. not all 100% identical) to the
ones shipped with version 1.1 of the MS framework.

Expected Results

		FullTrust	Intranet	Internet	Execution	Nothing
sandbox		ok		ok		ok		ok		fail [1]
whoami		ok		ok		fail		fail		fail [1]
sandbox whoami	ok		fail		fail		fail		fail [1]



Notes

[1]	This should be a "PolicyException: Execution permission cannot be 
	acquired." but it's a SecurityException on Mono (atm).
