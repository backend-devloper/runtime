* InheritanceDemand

notused.cs	StrongNameIdentityPermission on unused class, members ...

cas1.cs		StrongNameIdentityPermission on abstract class
cas2.cs		StrongNameIdentityPermission on virtual method
cas3.cs		StrongNameIdentityPermission on interface member

The cas#.cs tests are compiled two times. The first time (a) they aren't 
strongnamed (and not even delay-signed) using the cas.snk keypair. The second
time (b) they are strongnamed using cas.snk.

noncas1.cs	Non CAS (PrincipalPermission) on class (failure)
noncas2.cs	Non CAS (PrincipalPermission) on class (success)
noncas3.cs	Non CAS (PrincipalPermission) on method (failure)
noncas4.cs	Non CAS (PrincipalPermission) on method (success)


Notes

* Inheritance checks are done at load time so SecurityException are mostly
  uncatchable (unhandled).

* Changing SecurityManager.SecurityEnabled has _NO_ effect on 
  InheritanceDemand, even for classes that aren't yet loaded.
