INTRODUCTION

This directory (msvc) serves as a central location for 
all things needed to build the mono runtime using 
Microsoft Visual Studio.

When new exported API calls are added to the runtime, issue the
command:
	make update-def
in this directory and commit the resulting mono.def file.
This must happen on a Linux system, because we get the list
of the exported symbols from the generated shared library.
