The scripts in this directory are used to:

	* Extract the order, compiler and compilation flags for all
	  managed code in Mono.

	* Generate csproj files from the previous step

	* Support the generated csproj file

The idea is to ensure that we do not miss any compilation flag,
define, resource, reference, icon or any other element that might be
necessary to build the Mono class libraries.

* Extracting the Compilation Metadata

	The first step is to extract the compilation metadata from the
	existing Makefiles.  This is done in stages, first a fully
	working Mono compilation setup is required, and second the data
	is extracted.

	The extraction is done like this, from the toplevel Mono
	directory run:

		  make update-csproj

	With this input, it is possible to generate an XML file, to do
	this do:

	     	  make package-inputs

	This will generate order.xml, this contains the ordered list in
	which directories must be compiled as well as the command line
	options used to build it.

* Generate csproj files

	


To generate the "order" file, run the command: make csproj in the mcs directory on a fully
configured Mono setup (Linux or Cygwin)
