* Firebird and Interbase Data Provider

<ul>
	<li>Does not exist in Mono, but is a separate project
	
	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebase-net/">Firebird and Interbase
	Data Provider</a> for Microsoft .NET and Mono
	
	<li><a href="http://firebird.sourceforge.net/index.php">Firebird Relational Database</a> is 
	an independent project which uses source code based on the Interbase source code released
	by Borland under the Interbase Public License.
</ul>

* Current Status

<ul>
	<li>Currently, it is able to connect to Firebird and Interbase databases 
	   and execute commands
	   
	<li>The new data
 provider/driver is written in C# and provides a high-performance native
 implementation of the GDS32/API functions. This means that .Net developers
 will be able to access Firebird databases without the need of Firebird
 client install. In support of the new module, a new mailing list
 "firebird-net-provider" has been created. Please use this list for any 
 questions that you may have about the provider. This provider has been made
 available by Carlos Guzmán Álvarez (aka "Carlos G.A."), who has also made a
 number of contributions to the OdbcJdbc code.
</ul>   
   
* Action Plan

<ul>
	<li>Get it to work on Mono too
	
	<li>TODO
</ul>
