* Firebird and Interbase Data Provider

<ul>
	<li>Does not exist in Mono, but is a separate project</li>
	
	<li><a href="http://firebird.sourceforge.net/index.php">Firebird Relational Database</a> is 
	an independent project which uses source code based on the Interbase source code released
	by Borland under the Interbase Public License.</li>
	
	<li>Both the Firebird Relational Database and the Firebird .NET Data Provider can be
	downloaded from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebird/firebird">here</a></li>
	
	<li>The Firebird .NET Data provider has been made
 available by Carlos Guzmán Álvarez (aka "Carlos G.A."), who has also made a
 number of contributions to the OdbcJdbc code.</li>
 
	<li>Stuff that works:
		<ul>
			<li>CommandBuilder</li>
            <li>DataReader</li>
            <li>SchemaTable</li>
            <li>DataAdapter</li>
            <li>BatchQuerys</li>
            <li>ExecuteNonQuery</li>
        </ul>
	</li>
	
</ul>

* Current Status

<ul>
	<li>Currently, it is able to connect to Firebird and Interbase databases 
	   and execute commands</li>
	   
	<li>The new data
        provider/driver is written in C# and provides a high-performance native
        implementation of the GDS32/API functions. This means that .Net developers
        will be able to access Firebird databases without the need of Firebird
        client install.<li>
 
    <li>In support of the new module, a new mailing list
        <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/firebird-net-provider">firebird-net-provider</a> has 
        been created. Please use this list for any 
        questions that you may have about the provider.</li>       
    
    <li>CommandBuilder works</li>
 
</ul>   
   
* Action Plan

<ul>
	<li>Get it to work on Mono too</li>
	
	<li>Connection Pooling.</li>
</ul>
