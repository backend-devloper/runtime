@item Dec 9th, 2002: Mono 0.17 has been released

	Mono 0.17 has been released.  Check out the <a
	href="archive/mono-0.17">release notes</a> for a more detailed
	list.   You can get it <a href="download.html">here</a>

	Many new features as well as plenty of bug fixes.  Many new
	System.Data providers and a more mature System.Web (ASP.NET)
	which can now be hosted in any web server.  A simple <a
	href="archive/xsp-0.2.tar.gz">test web server</a> to host
	asp.net has been released as well.

	This release also includes a new exception handling system
	that uses the gcc exception information that vastly improves
	our internalcall speed (15% faster mcs compilation times).  

@item Dec 8th, 2002: VB.NET, Oracle Provider.

	Marco has got the Mono Basic compiler up to speed (support for
	classes, modules, expressions, object creation, method
	invocation, local variables, and some statements).  The
	compiler is based on the work from Rafael Teixeira on MCS.

	Screenshots: <a

	Daniel Morgan has checked in his Oracle provider to the CVS
	repository as well.

@item Nov 27th, 2002: Press release, tutorials, Windows Forms, ADO.NET, Magazine.

	<a
	href="http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/0,1640,45454,FF.html">The

	server on Unix using Mono.

	Martin Willemoes's <a href="gnometutorial">GNOME.NET
	tutorial</a> is now available from the main Mono site.  This
	tutorial is a collaborative effort to teach developers how to
	use Mono to create Mono applications using <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a>

	Dennis Hayes has posted and <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-December/003800.html">update</a>
	on the work to get Windows.Forms working on Mono.  There is a
	new test application that people can use to test their
	controls.  If you are interested in working on Windows.Forms,
	you can participate in the <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-winforms-list">mono-winforms

	layer</a> and an <a
	href="http://brianritchie.webhop.net/ideas/appserver.aspx">application
	server</a> for Mono.

	Dan Morgan has checked in his Oracle provider, and Tim Coleman
	continues to work on the TDS implementation of the data classes. 

	The rest of the team has been working on bug fixing in the
	runtime, the compiler, and the class libraries.  Also,
	compilation speed has increased recently by performing a
	number of simple optimizations in the compiler.

@item Nov 19th, 2002: Crypto update; Books; Gtk# Datagrid; .NET ONE Slides

	Sebastien has got DSA and RSA signatures <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-November/003497.html">working</a>
	as well as RSA <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-November/003502.html">encryption</a>.
	We now distribute Chew Keong TAN's BigInteger classes.

	Brian has contributed a System.Data multiplexor in Mono, it
	can be found in the Mono.Data assembly.  The details of this
	new technology are <a

@item Nov 8th, 2002: Mono s390, Database work, new JIT updates.

	Neale Ferguson has contributed <a href="download.html">RPM
	packages</a> of Mono for the Linux/s390.

	Tim Coleman posted an <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-November/003329.html">update</a>
	on the improvements in the System.Data

	The new JIT engine can run 72 out of our 154 tests for the
	virtual machine, and it also got exception support this week.

@item Nov 1st, 2002: TDS, Crypto, Gtk#, Winforms, bug fixes.

	Tim's SqlClient is <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-November/003161.html">now
	capable</a> of communicating with the Microsoft SQL server
	using the TDS protocol.  A screenshot showing a sample client
	running with <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a> on
	Windows is shown <a
	href="images/SqlSharpGtkSceenshot3.png">here</a>

	Sebastien has made all symetric ciphers functional on all
	supported modes; All the classes in Security.Cryptography are
	present and the X590 certificates are now in too.  Jackson has
	been working on the Security classes.

	Many bug fixes all over the place: class libraries (Dick,
	Piers, Ville, Zoltan, Gonzalo, Dan, Atsushi, Nick, Phillip),
	compiler, runtime engine.  A big thank goes for everyone who
	has been providing bug reports for us to track down.

	Gaurav has been working on multiple WebControls.  Gonzalo migrated
	the ASP.NET engine to use POST for interaction.

	In the Gtk# land saw the integration of gda, gnome-db and GStreamer
	bindings.

	Windows.Forms classes now build on Linux and Windows, check
	out the status pages for areas of collaboration.

@item Oct 24th, 2002: S390 support, XSP/ASP.NET, Win32 contributors, TDS.

	Today Neal Ferguson's support for the IBM S390 was checked
	into CVS.

	The XSP processor has been fully integrated into the
	System.Web assembly, and Gonzalo has finished the hosting
	interfaces in Mono.  This means that it is possible to embed
	ASP.NET with the same APIs used in Windows, and is possible to
	easily embed it with Apache for example.  The XSP module has
	now become a shell for testing the System.Web classes.

	We are looking for contributors that know Win32 to contribute
	to the Windows.Forms implementation.  If you want to help
	write some controls using the Win32 API, get in touch with our new <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-winforms-list">mono-winforms-list@ximian.com
	list</a> mailing list. 

	Tim's TDS System.Data set of classes can now talk to SQL
	servers using the TDS protocol (version 4.2) with
	connection pooling.  Currently it can connect, run
	transactions, update/insert/delete, and read some types.  A
	data adapter is also coming soon.
	
@item Oct 21th, 2002: Crypto, Winforms list, Database, GConf, Debugger.

	Sebastien Poliot has made a lot of progress, he reports that
	DES and TripleDES have been fixed;  Rijndael and CFB modes
	still have problems in some configurations and some areas that
	are not supported by the .NET framework.

	Last week we created a new <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-winforms-list">mailing
	list</a> to discuss the Mono Winforms implementation.

	Tim has started a full C# implementation of the TDS protocol
	and the providers, and Brian continues his work on his ODBC
	binding.  

	Rachel Hestilow has also checked in a binding for GConf.  This
	binding <a
	href="http://toxic.magnesium.net/~hestilow/gconfsharp/intro.html">is
	unique</a> in that it uses some features in the CLI to support
	complex data types, and allows the user to keep only one
	representation of the types instead of two (the master types
	is defined in CLI-land).  Also Property Editors (<a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/shots/gconf-shot.png">shot</a>)
	simplify the creation of user interfaces that bind their
	configuration to backend keys, following the <a
	href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/">GNOME
	Human Interface Guidelines.</a>

	Martin is now on vacation, but before leaving he produced a
	number of documents detailing the state of the debugger.  The
	major missing feature is full support for debugging unmanaged
	applications (it requires dwarf-2 handlers for types).  We
	will do some polishing of the user interface (<a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/shots/debugger-4.png">new
	shot</a>) to expose the existing and rich functionality to the
	users and try to release a preview of the debugger at the same
	time as Mono 0.17.

@item Oct 14th, 2002: Crypto, Database work, Debugger, Documentation.

	Brian, Daniel and Rodrigo have been busy working on the ODBC
	provider for Mono.  Daniel posted some <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-October/002755.html">updates</a>.
	Brian posted <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-October/002758.html">details
	about the ODBC.NET</a> provider.

	Also Sebastien Pouliot has been improving the various
	cryptographic classes in Mono, something that we had not done
	in quite some time.  We are looking for a way to handle
	big-nums.  We need either a managed or unmanaged set of
	classes for handling large numbers, and some volunteers to
	expose this functionality to C# (Either as an internal
	assembly, or as a set of P/Invoke, Internal call wrappers).

	Martin has got our debugger to support adding breakpoints at
	file/line combos.  This was more complex than generic
	breakpoints in routines, because these breakpoints are set on
	routines that probably have not been JITed just yet.  Martin's
	focus now is on stabilizing our debugger and aim for a public
	release of it.

	We have also imported the ECMA documentation into a separate
	module, and with the help from Scott Bronson we will have the
	necessary XSLT tools to finish our native documentation
	browser for Mono.  This together with the work from Adam will
	be the foundation for the <a href="classlib-doc.html">Mono
	Documentation Tools</a>. 

@item Oct 9th, 2002: Various Mono updates.

	Brian Ritchie, Daniel Morgan, Rodrigo Moya and Ville Palo have
	been working on various database providers.  The MySQL has
	seen a lot of work, and a new ODBC provider is now on CVS and
	more extensive regression tests have been checked in.

	Dick Porter is our background hero and keeps fixing the
	low-level bugs in the portability layer.  Now the Mono handle
	daemon should be a lot more robust and will no longer leave IPC
	regions.  Gonzalo Paniagua has initiated the migration of XSP
	into the System.Web class libraries now that we have a
	complete HttpRuntime implementation.  This means that you are
	able to embed the ASP.NET processor into any web server you
	want.  This also includes support for the system-wide
	configuration file `machine.config'.

	Martin Baulig has been busy with the Mono Debugger, you can see how
	it looks <a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/debugger-1.png">here</a>
	and <a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/debugger-2.png">here</a>.
	Now local variables and breakpoints are supported, and we are
	working on the UI elements to simplify their use (as seen on
	the screenshot).  

	<a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a> has seen a lot of
	activity specially as we start to build larger applications.
	Vladimir Vukicevic, Kristian Rietveld, Rachel Hestilow, Mike
	Kestner and Miguel de Icaza have been busy improving it.
	mPhoto which is a Photo management application for Mono and
	Gtk# is seen <a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/shots/mphoto-2.jpg">here</a>.

	Chris Toshok the man behind LDAP in Evolution continues to
	work on the Mono.LDAP# implementation.

	Dietmar Maurer and Paolo Molaro are still busy working on our
	new optimized JIT/ATC engine and are making great progress.
	The code base has been designed to ease the implementation of
	more advanced compiler optimizations, and optimizations can be
	chosen individually so they can be tuned for a particular
	processor, or use profile-based information to improve the
	performance.

@item Oct 1st, 2002: Mono 0.16 released;  Debugger updates.

	Mono 0.16 has been released.  Source and RPMs are <a
	href="download.html">available</a>.  The release notes are <a
	href="archive/mono-0.16">here</a>.  

	Martin's debugger can debug both managed and unmanaged code.
	Recently Martin added support for locals, parameters, and
	breakpoints on top of the existing infrastructure (his
	debugger supported instruction-level and source-code level
	single-stepping).

@item Sep 19th, 2002: Mono Survey.

	Help us plan for the future of Mono by filing out the <a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/monosurvey">First Mono
	Survey</a>

@item Sep 17th, 2002: Mono Hackers Hall of Fame: Sergey Chaban 

	The <a href="hackers.html">Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame</a>
	continues to show our appreciation to the excellent
	contributors that made <b>mono::</b> a successful free
	software project.

	This time the Hall of Fame welcomes Sergey Chaban.  Sergey has
	been a long time contributor to the project, from the early
	work on the class libraries that were critical to Mono's
	origin: every time you use a Hashtable in Mono, it runs
	Sergey's code, to the low-level optimizations on the JIT
	engine and to his work on ILASM and the PEToolkit. 

	
@item Sep 16th, 2002: Documentation Tools, ILASM, Debugger, Mono LDAP, Winforms

	Adam Treat has started moving the documentation universe again.  We
	have a new strategy to document our APIs (given that we have
	chosen <a href="classlib-doc.html">not to document the code
	inline</a>).  This includes the use of a master reference file
	that will hold the entry points to document.  All master files
	for our assemblies have been checked into CVS now.

	Sergey Chaban's Mono.PEToolkit and ILASM tools have been
	checked into CVS.  Although ILASM is old and will soon be
	updated, we wanted to get the build issues sorted out.

	Martin Baulig's Mono Debugger is still on its early stages,
	but you can run and run step by step your C# code and C code
	(including the Mono runtime).  Dwarf-2 is required to compile
	your code.  The regular step, step-into, and assembly-level
	step and step-into are supported.  And comes with a Gtk#
	UI. The debugger is written mostly in C# with some C glue
	code.  Most of the work is on the engine, we will be working
	on making a good UI in the future.

	Chris Toshok of the Hungry Programmer's fame has checked in
	Mono.Directory.LDAP, a C# wrapper for the LDAP libraries.
	This is the substrate for implementing the
	System.DirectoryServices assembly.

	Andrew has also continued with some of the cryptographic
	classes implementation.

	After much public debate, we have chosen a new <a
	href="winforms.html">strategy to implement winforms</a>.
	Implementing a Gtk, Qt or Aqua based version of Winforms was
	going to be almost as complex as implementing Wine itself.  So
	the new strategy is to only roll out a WineLib-based
	implementation. 

@item Sep 4th, 2002: .NET One 2002 Program available

	The <a
	href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/dotnet_2002/index.htm">.NET
	ONE 2002</a> conference in Frankfurt is now available.  Paolo
	will be talking about the Mono JIT and embedding the Mono
	runtime in your Windows and Linux applications.  Mike Kestner
	will talk about <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a> and
	the automatic binding generator used by Gtk# and Miguel will
	be talking about the Mono project on Monday's keynote and on
	the Mono C# compiler on Tuesday.

@item Sep 3rd, 2002: Apache integration

	<a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-September/001862.html">Sterling</a>
	announced an Apache module that hosts
	Mono, and allows CIL code to run from within Apache, giving the
	module access to the Apache runtime.  This uses the Mono embedding
	API.

@item Aug 24th, 2002: Gtk# 0.4 released

	Shortly after <a href="download.html">Mono 0.15</a> was
	released a fresh version of <a
	href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a> was <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-August/001702.html">announced</a>.

@item Aug 23rd, 2002: Mono 0.15 released

	Mono 0.15 has been released.  Source and RPMs are <a
	href="download.html">available</a>.  The release notes are <a
	href="archive/mono-0.15">here</a>

@item Aug 21th, 2002: Portable.NET encodings integrated into Mono.

	Rhys Weatherley has contributed the Portable.NET encoders to
	the Mono class libraries.  This is a great step towards
	cooperation between these projects.  Thanks to Paolo for doing the
	merger on our side.

	His encoders are more complete than the iconv-based approach
	that mono used, which was unreliable under certain
	circumstances.  

@item Aug 20th, 2002: Remoting work, Resources, SPARC checkins, ADO.NET

	Mark Crichton has checked in his patches to get the SPARC port
	on par with the PPC port.

	Dick has checked-in the resource reader and resource writers
	to the class libraries, and Dietmar checked in the C# support
	code for the remoting infrastructure.  

	More work on System.Data: the LibGDA (our OleDB backend) based
	providers are quickly maturing, and recently they executed
	their first query.

@item Aug 13th, 2002: MCS news, Gtk# progress, Windows.Forms, ADO.NET

	Martin Baulig has been fixing all the known bugs in the C#
	compiler and now has moved into improving the compilation
	speed and the generated code quality of MCS.  Today we got a
	50% speedup in the bootstrap of MCS going from 24 seconds to 12 seconds. 

	Gtk# has been making a lot of progress, some interesting
	corner cases are now supported:, you can now create canvas items as
	well as using the tree widget.  Here is a shot of <a
	href="images/mocil.png">MonoCIL</a>.

	On the runtime front, focus has been on improving remoting
	support, exception handling, as well as completing the support
	for structure marshaling.  

	Patrik is also back in action: the HttpRuntime infrastructure
	is rapidly improving, and Gonzalo is working into moving XSP
	into our main class library and providing the missing pieces
	to integrate with Patrik's code.

	Dennis and his team are working on a WineLib-based
	implementation of Windows Forms to guarantee that the corner
	cases of Windows.Forms can be handled, and we are back on track again.

	A lot more work on the ADO.NET and WebServices has also been
	checked into CVS.

@item Aug 1st, 2002: Mono Hackers Hall of Fame

	The <a href="hackers.html">Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame</a> has been started
	to show our appreciation to the excellent contributors that made <b>mono::</b>
	a successful free software project.

	The first, deserved, entry goes to
	Nick Drochak, who joined us in the first days of Mono and built the testing 
	infrastructure for the C# assemblies, fixed tons of bugs and even adventured 
	himself in the lands of the C runtime. His work is invaluable for keeping
	Mono on the right track through the daily changes in the codebase.

@item Looking for volunteers

	We are looking for volunteers to help complete various pieces
	of Mono and help move the project forward, we need
	contributions to:

	<ul>
		* More tests to the existing class libraries.
	
		* Finish existing class libraries, check our <a
		href="class-status.html">class status</a> pages to see
		all the missing things.  There are open tasks all over
		the place: XML, Database access, enterprise services,
		configuration, ASP.NET, Drawing APIs, and more.

		* Since we have now ASP.NET running, we would like to 
		create an ASP.NET application to maintain our class
		library documentation.

		We have some special needs (read them <a
	 	href="classlib-doc.html">here</a>).     There is a
		prototype written using Windows.Forms, but we believe
		it will be faster to have this done using ASP.NET (and
		it is also a nice way of stress testing it).

		* Support for the VB runtime: we need contributions
		to make our VB runtime mature enough to host
		applications compiled with the VB.NET to run with
		Mono.

		* We need people to help write the documentation: you
		can start editing our XML files by hand, and once we
		have the ASP.NET tool, upgrade to that.

@item July 31st, 2002: Flow Analysis

	Martin has checked into CVS the data flow analysis patch for
	MCS, this means that we now correctly implement definite

	an update</a> on the ASP.NET widgets that are still pending.  Patrik is back, and he is 
	working with Gonzalo to streamline the pipeline

	Rachel quietly committed to Gtk-Sharp support for marshaling
	structures (very important for Gtk#).  This uses extensively
	the new marshaling code that Dietmar added to the runtime.

	Dietmar is also now sharing more code for P/Invoke using his
	intermediate representation.  Another step to share more code, and 
	simplify the porting and maintenance process.

	The Mono runtime can now be embedded into your application
	(also known as "CLR hosting").  See the sample in
	mono/samples/embed.  This allows your application to link with

@item Jul 16th, 2002

	Paolo today got mono to complete host itself on Linux.  This
	means that we can now compile the `corlib' using the Mono C#
	compiler and the Mono runtime.

	Compiling the corlib was rather tricky, because the types that
	the compiler uses during the compilation process will come
	from the source code it is compiling.  

	After a few months of work, we have finally fleshed out all
	the remaining bugs.  Now the next step is to update the makefiles
	to compile with the Mono tool-chain.

	A recapitulation:
	<ul>
		* The Mono C# compiler was able to compile itself on December 28th, 2001.
		  The resulting image contained errors though.

		* The Mono C# compiler was able to self-compile in on
		  January 3rd, 2002.  Becoming a self-hosting compiler on Windows.

		* The Mono runtime matured enough by March 12, 2002 that it
		  was able to bootstrap the Mono C# compiler on Linux using our interpreter.
		  This means that our development tool was self sufficient.

		* On March 26th, the JIT engine was fixed, so we could use this to
		  run the compiler on Linux.

		* Martin fixed the remaining bugs in the compiler that stopped it from
	 	  compiling the `corlib'.  The resulting image still contained errors though.

		* On July 8th, Radek got the PowerPC port to bootstrap
		  the C# compiler.  This is important, because it exposed
	  	  various tricky issues in a big-endian system.

		* Today: we can bootstrap the compiler using libraries
		  and the compiler compiled with itself on Linux.  The process is complete.
	</ul>

	In the meantime, Dietmar has quietly implemented the remaining
	pieces of Marshalling in the Mono runtime.   This is very
	important for the Gtk# guys to move on with their bindings.

	To make things more interesting, he replaced most of the
	architecture specific code generation for trampolines
	(delegates, invocations, function and p/invoke trampolines) to
	use CIL.  This CIL is then compiled on the flight by the JIT
	Compiler engine.  By doing this, we have reduced the burden to
	port the JITer to new architectures, and that our trampoline
	code is cross platform.

@item Jul 9th, 2002

	Ajay was the first to notice <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-July/000641.html">
	Mono's first birthday</a>.

	In a year, we have achieved plenty:
	<ul>
		* 94 contributors with CVS access (84 non-Ximian developers).
		* A complete CLI implementation:
		<ul>
			<li> A fast and performing x86 JIT engine (inlining, constant propagation).
			<li> An interpreter for other systems (PPC, Sparc, StrongArm).
		</ul>
		* A self-hosting C# compiler, which can compile its class libraries.
		* 37,140 file changes in CVS.
		* 92,000 lines of C code.
		* 437,000 lines of C# code (compiler, classes, tests)
		* A working core for ASP.NET and ADO.NET.
		* Major subsystems are functional: RegularExpressions,
		  System.XML, XML.Schema, System.Data, System.Web.
		* The Gtk# project, which is maturing rapidly.
	</ul>

	Thanks to everyone who has made Mono possible with their
	feedback, regression tests, their comments, their help on the mailing
	list, code contributions, complete classes, bug reporting, the
	countless hours of bug hunting.  This project would not have
	been possible without every contribution.  

	It has been a great year for everyone involved in the
	project.  I think we have built a new and exciting community.

	Now we have a solid foundation to build on, so this next year
	looks even more exciting: not only because we will see more
	Mono applications, but we will begin using Mono as an
	`library' to be linked with applications that want to get
	scripting-like features; Gtk# is our ticket to create nice
	GNOME applications; And we will be developing CORBA bindings
	to integrate with other object systems.

	Also, for those interested in optimizations and tuning, this
	year we will get to play with more advanced optimizations and
	all kinds of interesting research ideas for improving Mono
	code generation.

	A special thanks to the Mono developers at Ximian for managing
	to survive their manager and a special thanks to our
	regression test marshal Nick Drochak, who has been hunting
	down, and fixing code in our class libraries and keeping us on
	track for so long.

@item Jul 8th, 2002

	Radek today fixed the last bugs to get Mono to self host on
	Linux/PowerPC.

	Alp Toker has released version 0.5 of <a
	href="http://www.atoker.com/phonic/">Phonic</a>, a media
	player for .NET. Phonic makes extensive use of Mono-developed
	technologies such as Gtk# and csvorbis (Ogg player ported by
	Mark). Hopefully we will be seeing many more exciting
	applications like these in the near future.

	Dietmar has been moving a lot of the architecture specific
	code in the JIT engine to our internal representation.  This
	means that porting the JIT is simpler now, as there is less
	architecture-specific code to maintain.  The inliner, constant
	folder and constant propagation are also done at the
	architecture independent layer.

	Gonzalo is now running the sample ASP.NET applications on
	Linux with the Mono runtime.  It still needs polishing though,
	and help with the various ASP.NET controls would be
	appreciated.  The ASP.NET community seems more poor than the
	PHP community, we need to have a few open source controls to
	do things dynamic rendering (libart+gdk-pixbuf again can do
	most of the work), charts and components like the kind of
	thing you see in the PHP universe: to bring nice GPL code to
	the masses of Windows developers, lure them into the world of
	Linux.

	Dick has also got us the new Process implementation that
	implements the Win32 semantics.  Now only redirection is
	missing.

	Martin Baulig fixed the remaining bugs that prevented MCS to
	compile our corlib.  The compilation was tricky because of the way
	MCS bootstraps the compile (internally mcs uses the types that are
	being defined at that point to perform compares).

	Martin and Paolo have been working hard on fixing the
	remaining issues.  Currently 102 test pass and 15 fail with
	our resulting corlib.

	Jesus' SoapFormatter classes are now in CVS.

	I have been redoing the type lookup system for MCS.  The
	interesting bit is that I did most of this work on an airplane
	using MCS itself.  Which is a good test that the compiler is 
	now a good development tool.

	Duncan, Mike and Rachel have been hard at work with Gtk#, now
	there are bindings for the GtkHTML widget (the one used by
	Evolution's composer).  And Rachel also got the beginning of GNOME
	bindings, that should simplify application development.

	On Monday Piers Haken <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-June/000380.html">contributed</a>
	the core to support XPath in Mono: most of the w3c spec is
	implemented (modulo a few pending bits).

	Dick checked in his implementation of the Process classes:
	process forking and waiting support committed, with some functions to
	query status.  This was complex as we had to emulate the Win32
	environment, but this is another step to be fully compatible.
	This means for example that any process can check on the
	status of any other process (without the parent/child relationship)

	Of course, those interested
	in only the Unix semantics can always P/Invoke the Unix calls.

	is part of the ASP.NET support.

	<b>Docs:</b> John Barnette, John Sohn and Adam Treat have been
	hacking on MonoDoc.

	<b>ADO.NET:</b> Daniel Morgan and Rodrigo Moya have been
	working on the <a href="ado-net">ADO.NET</a> support, and got
	the first signs of life this week (we can connect, insert
	rows; do transactions: commit/rollback; SQL errors and
	exceptions work).  Check <a
	href="mailing-lists.html">mono-patches</a> for all the
	goodies.

	<b>Optimizations:</b> A number of optimizations in the runtime
	made the compiler twice as fast this week:

	Early this week Patrik started the string
	rewrite in the runtime.  Today Dietmar finished the
	constructors and deployed the new layout. 

	Paolo got the JIT engine to generate profiles, which were in
	turn used to find hot spots in Reflection, which he improved.

	Daniel Lewis (of Regex fame) noticed the performance issues
	with our current array layout, and contributed a new array
	representation.

	At the same time Dietmar started the the JIT inline code and
	implemented constant propagation.  These two optimizations
	together are very powerful.

	<b>Bug fixing:</b> And of course everyone has been helping out
	with the bug fixing (Duncan, Gonzalo, Jonathan, Miguel, Nick,
	Ravi, Sergey)

	Martin has been working on our debugging infrastructure, both
	on the JIT side of things (adding dward support) as well as on
	the class libraries (so that MCS can start generating
	debugging information).
	
	Jason and Kral keep working on the System.Xml namespace,
	allowing Mike to move more to self-hosting his Gtk# code.  

	The System.Web classes are now part of the build (and they are
	also part of the class status now).  Ajay contributed a large
	chunk of code to the System.Xml.Schema namespace

	Dan (of regex fame) has been working on internal calls
	support: moving more code from the old monowrapper to become
	internal calls.

	Paolo and Dietmar are working steadily on our runtime
	environment, fixing bugs, adding missing features and allowing
	us to run the compiler on Linux.

	Remember to post your bug reports.

	The nice class status on the right is brought to you by
	endless hacking hours from Piers and Nick.  These status
	report pages have been helping us track down various mistakes
	in our classes (very useful, check it out for yourself)

	Nick is still leading our test suite platform.  I can not
	stress how important it is to have a good regression test suite
	for our platform, as buggy class libraries are what are
	stopping the compiler from running completely on Linux.

	We are of course psyched to see Mono run on

	<a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/dick-mis-server.png">screenshot</a>

	Paolo and Dietmar are busy making our runtime self sufficient on 
	non-Windows platforms.  

	C# compiler front:  A lot of focus in the past weeks after
	the C# became self hosting has been in making the compiler a useful
	tool for development: improve error handling, provide better error
	reports, fixing all known bugs, and finally profiling of the compiler
	has begun.

@item Jan 8, 2002

	Our compiler has been self-supporting since January 3rd.  In
	the meantime, we have been busy working on making it run on

	the compiler compiled `console.cs' (a sample Mono program) on
	Linux.

	We will soon have the first non-Microsoft C# implementation!

@item Dec 18, 2001

	JIT: More work on our IO abstraction layer (Dick). 

	JIT: exception handling for unmanaged code (Dietmar)

	System.Reflection: Support for PropertyInfo and
	PropertyBuilder as well as the various queries for MethodBase.

	C#: Pre-processor; Rewrite of MemberLookup which fixed many of
	the outstanding issues.  More bug fixing allows it to compile
	more programs.

@item Dec 14, 2001

	Dietmar has improved the register allocation and now Mono performs
	two to three times as fast as it did yesterday.  Amazing.

	The compiler keeps moving along, explicit interface
	implementation is there.

@item Dec 11, 2001

	The JIT engine can now run all the compiler regression tests as 
	well as assorted other programs, many more opcodes added
	recently.  Currently the JIT engine uses a very simplistic register
	allocator (just enough to allow us to focus on feature completeness)
	and that will be the next major task to improve performance and
	reduce spills and reloads. 

	On the C# compiler front: language features are now pretty
	much complete.  The big missing tasks are unsafe code support,
	visibility, explicit interface implementation plus static flow
	analysis.  There are many small bugs that need to be addressed.

	You can get your copy of the <a href="snapshots">latest Mono</a>

	More work is also required on fixing the foundation class
	libraries, it is easy to find spots now since Nick got the
	`make test' going.

	Recursive enumeration definition in the C# compiler are
	working now (Ravi).

	More work on the Web classes (Gaurav).

@item Nov 28, 2001

	JIT land: Paolo got GDB support into the JIT engine while
	Dietmar added exceptions support to it.

	The C# compiler supports all array initializations now, and the
	switch statement as well as fixing many existing bugs.  Many
	new more tests.
	
	Nick keeps working on improving our class library test suite.

	Dick has almost completed the Mono IO layer.

<blockquote>
	Paolo today got the Mono C# compiler running <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2001-November/001941.html">on
	Linux</a>.  It compiles a sample program and then the sample
	program is executed.

	Mutator unary operators (++ and --) in the compiler are fully
	functional, they used to only work on variables, and now they
	are complete.

	To sum things up: The Mono C# compiler is written in C# and
	uses the .NET classes to get its work done.  To make this work
	on Linux work has to happen in various fronts:
<ul>
		* The C# compiler is being worked on and can compile
		  many programs now (our test suite at this point is 
		  made up of 40 tests).

		* The class libraries need to be mature enough to support
		  the compiler, particularly System.Reflection.Emit (which is 
		  what Paolo has been working on lately). 

	  	  The compiler currently requires 103 classes from the
		  .NET runtime (you can get the list by running: <b>monodis --typeref mcs.exe</b>

		* The interpreter should be mature enough to run the actual
		  compiler byte codes and the corlib bytecodes.
