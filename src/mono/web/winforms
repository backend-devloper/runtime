* System.Windows.Forms

	<p>Currently Windows.Forms support is under development. Check Mono's <a 
	href = "http://www.go-mono.com/mono-roadmap.html">Roadmap</a> for more 
	details on when it is going to be available.

	<p>System.Windows.Forms in Mono is implemented using System.Drawing and 
	Wine. This allows applications that use P/Invoke to call Win32 functions 
	or rely on event delivery through the Wndproc method to work as 
	expected. This is the path of best compatibility.
	
	<p>In terms of integrating visually with the desktop, we are hoping to 
	contribute to the Wine project a mechanism to make it use the Gtk+ 
	themes on X11 and Cocoa on MacOS to render the widgets, and get the 
	native look and feel on each of these platforms. 
	
* Installation

	<p>To get the Windows.Forms support working, you need:
	
	<ul>
	
	<li> The latest <a href = "http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">Mono</a> package.
	<li> The latest <a href = "http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">libgdiplus</a> library.
	<li> The latest <a href = "http://www.cairographics.org/download">Cairo</a> vector graphics library.
	<li> A recent copy of <a href="http://www.winehq.com/">Wine</a>.
	<li> A recent copy of WineLib (do a cvs co winelib from Mono's CVS).
	
	</ul>

	<p>The Winforms effort is being coordinated in the <a

	<p>If you want to help, you can pick a control and start implementing it's 
	methods. You can do this either on Windows or on Linux. Try using 
	System.Drawing calls instead of P/Invoked Win32 calls. 

	<p>If you choose a particular control to work on, send a note to the 
	winforms list to avoid duplication of effort.
