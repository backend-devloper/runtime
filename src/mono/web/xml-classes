* XML Classes

** Abstract

  XML library is used by several field of Mono such as ADO.NET and XML 
  Digital Signature (xmldsig). Here I write about System.Xml.dll and 
  related tools. This page won't include any classes which are in other 
  assemblies such as XmlDataDocument.

  Note that current corlib has its own XML parser class named Mono.Xml.MiniParser.

  Basically System.XML.dll feature has finished, or almost finished, so
  I write this page mainly for bugs and improvement hints.


** System.Xml namespace


*** Document Object Model (Core)

  DOM feature has already implemented. There is still missing feature.

	<ul>
	* ID constraint support is problematic because W3C DOM does not specify
	  handling of ID attributes into non-adapted element. (MS.NET also 
	  looks incomplete in this area).

	* I think, event feature is not fully tested. There are no concrete
	  desctiption on which events are risen, so we have to do some
	  experiment on MS.NET.
	</ul>

*** Xml Writer

  Here XmlWriter almost equals to XmlTextWriter. If you want to see
  another implementation, check XmlNodeWriter.cs used in monodoc.

  XmlTextWriter is completed. However, it looks nearly twice as slow as 
  MS.NET (I tried 1.1)

*** XmlResolver

  Currently XmlTextReader uses specified XmlResolver. If nothing was supplied,
  then it uses XmlUrlResolver. XmlResolver is used to parse external DTD,
  importing XSL stylesheets and schemas etc.

  However, XmlUrlResolver is still buggy (mainly because System.Uri is also
  incomplete yet) and this results in several loading error.

  XmlSecureResolver, which is introduced in MS .NET Framework 1.1 is basically
  implemented, but it requires CAS (code access security) feature. We need to
  fixup this class after ongoing CAS effort works.


*** XmlNameTable

  XmlNameTable itself is implemented. However, it should be actually used in
  several classes. Currently it makes sense if compared names are both in
  the table, but if it is obvious that compared names are both in this table,
  it should be simply compared using ReferenceEquals() (if these names are
  different, the comparison is still inefficient yet).


*** Xml Stream Reader

  When we are using ASCII document, we don't care which encoding we are using.
  However, XmlTextReader must be aware of the specified encoding in XML
  declaration. So we have internal XmlStreamReader class (and currently
  XmlInputStream class. This may disappear since XmlStreamReader is enough to
  handle this problem).

  However, there are some problems lies in these classes on reading network
  stream (especially on Linux). This should be fixed soon.


*** XML Reader

  XmlTextReader, XmlNodeReader and XmlValidatingReader are almost finished.

	- Most of the OASIS conformance test passes as Microsoft does, but
	  about W3C tests, it is not perfect.

	- I won't add any XDR support on XmlValidatingReader. (I haven't
	  ever seen XDR used other than Microsoft's BizTalk Server 2000,
	  and Now they have 2003 with XML Schema support)

  XmlTextReader and XmlValidatingReader should be faster than now. Currently
  XmlTextReader looks nearly twice as slow as MS.NET, and XmlValidatingReader
  (which uses this slow XmlTextReader) looks nearly three times slower. (Note
  that XmlValidatingReader won't be slow as itself. It uses schema validating
  reader and dtd validating reader.)


**** Some Advantages

  The design of Mono's XmlValidatingReader is radically different from
  that of Microsoft's implementation. Under MS.NET, DTD content validation
  engine is in fact simple replacement of XML Schema validation engine.
  Mono's DTD validation is designed fully separate and does validation
  as normal XML parser does. For example, Mono allows non-deterministic DTD.

  Another advantage of this XmlValidatingReader is support for *any* XmlReader.
  Microsoft supports only XmlTextReader.

  I added extra support interface named "IHasXmlParserContext", which is
  considered in XmlValidatingReader.ResolveEntity(). Microsoft failed to 
  design XmlReader to support pluggable use of XmlReader (i.e. wrapping use
  of other XmlReader) since XmlParserContext is required to support both
  entity resolution and namespace manager. (In .NET 1.2, Microsoft also 
  supported similar to IHasXmlParserContext, named IXmlNamespaceResolver,
  but it still does not provide any DTD information.)

  We also have RELAX NG validating reader. See mcs/class/Commons.Xml.Relaxng.


** System.Xml.Schema

*** Schema Object Model

  Basically it is implemented. Some features still needs to fix:

	- Complete facet support. Currently some of them is missing. Recently
	  David Sheldon is doing several fixes on them.

	- Complete derivation by restriction (DBR) support. Especially
	  substitution group won't work with it (However, I won't recommend
	  both substitution group and DBR, regardless of this incompleteness.)

  Some bugs are remaining, but as far as I tried W3C XML Schema test suite 
  with bugfixes (of test suite), only 69 out of 7581 has failed. With my test
  suite fix, MS.NET failed 48 cases.

*** Validating Reader

  XML Schema validation feature is (currently) implemented on
  Mono.Xml.Schema.XsdValidatingReader, which is internally used in
  XmlValidatingReader. 
  
  Basically this is implemented and actually its feature is almost complete,
  but I have only did validation feature testing. So we have to write more 
  tests on properties, methods, and events (validation errors).


** System.Xml.Serialization

  Lluis rules ;-)

  Well, in fact XmlSerializer is almost finished and is on bugfix phase.
  However, more tests are required especially schema import and export
  feature. Please try xsd.exe to create classes from schema, or schema
  from class. And if any problems were found, please file it to bugzilla.


** System.Xml.XPath and System.Xml.Xsl

  There are two implementations for XSLT. One (and historical) implementation
  is based on libxslt. Now we uses fully implemented managed XSLT.

  Putting aside bug fixes, we have to support:

 	- embedded script (such as VB, C#, JScript). So some packages like 
	  latest NAnt (for MS.NET) won't be compiled.

  It would be nice if we can support <a href="http://www.exslt.org/">EXSLT</a>.
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/WebServices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnexxml/html/xml05192003.asp">Microsoft has already done it</a>, but it
  is not good code since it depends on internal concrete derivatives of
  XPathNodeIterator classes. In general, .NET's "extension objects" is not
  usable to return node-sets, so if we support EXSLT, it has to be done
  internally inside our System.XML.dll. Volunteers are welcome.

  Our managed XSLT implementation is still inefficient. XslTransform.Load()
  and .Transform() looks three times slower (However it depends on 
  XmlTextReader which is also slow, so we are starting optimization from 
  that class, not XSLT itself). These number are only for specific cases,
  and there might be more critical point on XSLT engine (mainly
  XPathNodeIterator).


** Miscellaneous Class Libraries

*** RELAX NG

  I implemented an experimental RelaxngValidatingReader. It is far from
  complete, especially simplification stuff (see RELAX NG spec chapter 4),
  some constraints (in chapter 7), and datatype handling.

  I am planning improvements (starts with renaming classes, giving more
  kind error messages, supporting compact syntax and even object mapping),
  but it is still my wishlist.


** Tools

*** xsd.exe

  xsd.exe is used to:

	1) generate classes source code from schema
	2) generate DataSet classes source code from schema
	3) generate schema documents from assembly (classes)
	4) infer schema documents from XML instance
	5) convert XDR into XSD

  As descrived above, I won't work on 5) XDR stuff.

  Current xsd.exe supports 1) and 3) 

  As for 2) and 4), Currently there is no works on them. (This inference
  feature is rather DataSet specific than general purpose use.)

  Microsoft has another inference class from XmlReader to XmlSchemaCollection.
  It may be useful, but it won't be so easy.

  any volunteers?
